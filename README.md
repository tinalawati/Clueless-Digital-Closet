## Usage

Simply replace the default images with your own images inside the 'top_images' and 'bottom_images' directories. The file names must follow the format 'top_X' and 'bottom_X' in order for the script to detect them, e.g. 'top_1' and 'bottom_1'.

Then, run the following command:
```python
python digital_closet_app.py
```
